Ruby Project 2

1.  Create an array of names.
      names = ["Larry", "Jenny", "Larryn", "Jared"]
      
2.  Sort that array (ascending) in alphabetical order.
      names.sort
      
3.  Remove the first item from the array.
      names.delete_at(0)

4.  Remove the last item from the array.
      names.pop

5.  Reverse the order of the array.
      names.reverse

6.  Iterate through the array and print the name to the screen.
      print names

7.  Create a hash with the KEY being a name and the VALUE being the type of car they drive ("Steve" as the key and "Taurus" as the value)
      property = {"Larry"=>"Aston Martin", "Jenny"=>"Bentley", "Larryn"=>"BMW", "Jared"=>"Porsche"}

8.  Iterate through the hash printing the name and the type of car they drive to the screen.
      puts property


9.  For one of the names, change the car they drive.
      property.delete("Jenny")
      property["Jenny"] = "Volvo"


10. What are the primary differences between an Array and a Hash. When/why would you use one over the other?

      ยบ Use arrays when the order matters
      ยบ Use hashes when the label matters
